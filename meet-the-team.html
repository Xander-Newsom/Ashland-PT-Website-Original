            <p>Michelle is originally from Dallas, Texas, but pursued both her bachelor and masters degrees at Chatham College in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  She graduated in 2000 with her BS in Behavioral Neuroscience, and then in 2002 with her Masters in Physical Therapy.  She started her career in Dallas after graduation and then moved to Virginia to continue practicing. Since moving to Richmond, she has worked in many settings as a physical therapist, including Sheltering Arms Rehabilitation hospital, Children’s Hospital of Richmond, Bon Secours hospitals, and skilled nursing facilities, allowing her to maintain a varied portfolio of skills and continue to grow as a physical therapist in all areas.  In 2014, she returned to Ashland Physical Therapy with Matt Pulisic and has remained in Ashland ever since, working in the outpatient setting to serve patients with orthopedic and neurological injuries in the community. She loves working with patients with orthopedic injuries or post surgery, but has a special affinity for the geriatric population and anyone with neurological conditions, including stroke recovery and vestibular dysfunction.  She feels comfortable working with clients of all ages and ailments, and truly loves the community of Ashland, where she has worked for more than 2 decades.</p>
            <p>In her free time, she enjoys being with her family and friends and exploring the area around central Virginia and the mountains. She grew up playing soccer and played through college and beyond, but hung up her cleats to coach her boys through youth. While she does not continue to play or coach now, she is a lover of games and play in general and believes that we need to play more in our lives.  She has a loving husband and two wonderful boys that continue to support her in all her adventures!</p>
